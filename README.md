# Word-composition-problem
In this problem we are given two files as input where some words and composite words are present. We need to find the longest composite word among them.

For that I used Python Language. I created a function that will check a word is compounded or not by separating the words into prefixs and suffixs and doing that with recuration. Then I created a function that will find the longest and second longest word with the property "Composite". Then in main functionm, taking those two input files and process them. Also calculate the start and end time by time module of python.
